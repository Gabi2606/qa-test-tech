## Part 1: Test case creation

Following, there is the test we propose to developers. As the QA member of the team you have to design the right and precise test cases to give the team the confidence of a good test coverage. There are no limits nor restrictions, just express yourself.

### Cashier System
Simple cashier function that adds products to a cart and displays the total price. The following products are registered:

| Product Code  | Name         |  Price |
|---            |---           |---     |
| GR1           | Green Tea    | £3.11  |
| SR1           | Strawberries | £5.00  |
| CF1           |  Coffee      | £11.23 | 

**Special Rules**
* Buy one get one free
* Buy > N products, pay X price per product
* Buy > N products, pay X% of the original price

**Products and Discount Rules**
The project doesn't connect to a database, it reads both the products and rules from a YAML file.
¡
Currently there are only 3 types of configurable discount rules:
* FreeRule (buy N get N free)
* ReducedPriceRule (buy more than N pay a different price)
* FractionPriceRule (buy more than N, pay a percentage of the original price)
